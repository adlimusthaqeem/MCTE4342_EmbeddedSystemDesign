Design a power-efficient embedded system for a 20-key IR remote control.
When any button has been pressed, call a function Transmit().
Assume that this function has already been written.
Buttons are connected to Port B (0 to 5), Port C (0 to 5), Port D (0 to 7)

Tip: 
Sleep to conserve power!
You can use pin change interrupts to wake up the CPU.
